\section{Application:}\label{application}}

``Spectral Feature Space, Vegetation On Bands B04 and B08''

One of the applications really attracted me was the spatial signature of
vegetation on the terra, as we could assign features to each end of the
spatial signature area see Figure~\ref{fig-vege}, such as bare land on
the right end of the triangle-like area where red light captured are
dense while near-infrared level is low. Heavy vegetation are witnessed
at the upper end of the triangle-like area where red light low and
near-infrared is high, indicating heavy biomass. As for the left-down
corner where both red and near-infrared are low, we can identify wet
lands. This is integrated in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index) to estimate vegetation cover.

Spatial signatures can also be used to monitor the health of vegetation
by identifying patterns of quavariation in spectral reflectance that are
indicative of stress or disease. For example, vegetation that is
stressed or diseased may have a different spectral reflectance signature
than healthy vegetation, which can be identified using spatial
signatures.

In addition, spatial signatures can be used to monitor the growth and
distribution of vegetation over time by comparing satellite imagery from
different dates. This can be useful for understanding the impacts of
land use changes, climate change, and other factors on vegetation.

Overall, spatial signatures are a powerful tool for vegetation
monitoring, as they can be used to identify and classify different types
of vegetation, monitor vegetation health, and track vegetation changes
over time.

\hypertarget{reflection}{%
\section{Reflection}\label{reflection}}

just state what interest you and why, as well as the application.
Application: Context matters. Why useful? What had it assisted
achieving. Mind map of concepts, to show understanding of data and
workflow

One of the challenges I encountered is to navigate the complexities of
the interface of SNAP and QGIS. It becomes clear to me that yes
implementing several functions in code can be challenging, but a
software with collective functions as a whole can be mindblowing even
when with decent GUIs. Specifically, finding which function falling
under which menu consumes a lot of time, and figuring out filling
parameters to carry the analysis also took some efforts of iterative
validation.

When doing the operation in R on a script level, it becomes confusing
where I put the data

\subsection{Different Sensors}\label{different-sensors}}

Across track scanners: Mirror reflects light onto 1 detector. For
example, \uline{Landsat} dataset are captured by this sort

Along track scanners: Basically several detectors pushed along. E.g.,
Quickbird, SPOT

\hypertarget{geometric-correction}{%
\subsection{Geometric Correction}\label{geometric-correction}}

RS data could include image distortions introduced by: View angle,
topography, wind and rotation of the earth

We identify Ground Control Points (GCP) in distorted data to match them
with local map, correct image, or GPS data from handheld device, but
these reference images could also contain distortions and imprecisions.

RMSE is adopted here to measure fitness between images. Use GCPs to
minimise RMSE.

Doing geometric correction can shift the original image, so we want to
re-sample the final raster by using Nearest Neighbour, Linear, Cubic,
Cubic spline re-samplers

\hypertarget{atmosphric-correction}{%
\subsection{Atmosphric Correction}\label{atmosphric-correction}}

According to Jensen (1986), two factors contribute to environmental
attenuation: Atmospheric scattering, topographic attenuation.

There are unnecessary and necessary atmospheric corrections:

necessary ones are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Biophysical parameters needed (e.g.~temperature, leaf area index,
  NDVI)
\item
  E.g. .. .NDVI is used in the Africa Famine Early Warning System and
  Livestock Early Warning System
\item
  Using spectral signatures through time and space
\end{itemize}

Absorption and scattering can create the haze, i.e.~reduces contrast of
image.

Scattering can create the ``adjacency effect'', radiance from pixels
nearby mixed into pixel of interest.

\hypertarget{orthorectification-correction}{%
\subsection{Orthorectification
Correction}\label{orthorectification-correction}}

This is a subset of georectification, i.e.~giving coords to an image.
Particularly Orthorectification means removing distortion so pixels can
appear being viewed at \uline{nadir} (straight down). This requires the
support of an Elevation Model to calculate the nadir view for each pixel
on a sensor geometry.

To do this: cosine correction, Minnaert correction, Statistical
Empirical correction, C Correction (advancing the Cosine). Need radiance
(DN to TOA) from sloped terrain, Sun's zenith angle, Sun's incidence
angle - cosine of the angle between the solar zenith and the normal line
of the slope. Latter two found in angle coefficient files (e.g.~Landsat
data ANG.txt).

\hypertarget{rdiometric-correction}{%
\subsection{Rdiometric Correction}\label{rdiometric-correction}}

Corrections to raw satellite imagery can be performed using a method
called Dark Object Subtraction (DOS). The logic is that the darkest
pixel in the image should be 0 and any value it has is due to the
atmosphere. To remove the atmospheric effect, the value from the darkest
pixel is subtracted from the rest of the pixels in the image. The
calculation involves converting the Digital Number (DN) to radiance,
computing the haze value for each band (but not beyond NIR), and
subtracting the 1\% reflectance value from the radiance. The calculation
requires values such as mean exoatmospheric irradiance, solar azimuth,
Earth-sun distance, and others, which can be found in sources such as
Landsat user manuals.

\hypertarget{joining-data-sets}{%
\subsection{Joining data sets}\label{joining-data-sets}}

Also known as \uline{Mosaicking}: We feather two images, creating a
\uline{seamless} mosaic, where the diving lien is called
\uline{seamline}.

\hypertarget{image-enhancements}{%
\subsection{Image Enhancements}\label{image-enhancements}}

Image stretch, Band ratioing, Normalised Burn Ratio, Edge enhancement,
Filtering, PCA, Image fusion (see application) etc.

\hypertarget{application---discussing-image-fusion-in-one-literature}{%
\section{Application - Discussing image fusion in one
literature}\label{application---discussing-image-fusion-in-one-literature}}

\includegraphics{./images/image-620878088.png}

From literature we delve in the nuances of levels on which we perform
image fusion to acquire better results. The integration methods vary as
the levels vary (Schulte to Bühne and Pettorelli 2018).

Satellite remote sensing (SRS) can be derived from Multispectral sensors
and radar sensors.~

~Multispectral sensors are passive, merely receiving electromagnetic
waves reflected from surface, usually used to reflect chemical
properties (such as nitrogen or carbon content and moisture). Usually
produces data with comparatively low spatial resolution

~Radar ones emit electromagnetic radiation and measure the returning
signal, responding to the three-dimensional structure of objects, being
sensitive to their orientation, volume and surface roughness. Usually
produces data with comparatively high spatial resolution

\hypertarget{image-fusion}{%
\subsection{Image fusion:}\label{image-fusion}}

1.~\textbf{decision-level}~(SRS integration), where separate predictors
are used to estimate a parameter of interest.~

2.~\textbf{object-level (feature-level).}~unit: multi-pixel objects. (1)
using radar and multispectral imagery is input into an object-based
image segmentation algorithm, or (2) segmenting each type of imagery
separately before combining them. multi-pixel objects

3.~\textbf{pixel-level (Observation-level)}, where pixel values are
combined to derive a fused image with new pixel values, either in the
spatial or the temporal domain.

(2. and 3. derive entirely new predictors.)

\end{figure}

Schematic overview of multispectral-radar SRS data fusion techniques.
The parameter of interest can be a categorical variable, like land
cover, or a continuous variable, like species richness. In pixel-level
fusion, the original pixel values of radar and multispectral imagery are
combined to yield new, derived pixel values. Object-based fusion refers
to (1) using radar and multispectral imagery is input into an
object-based image segmentation algorithm, or (2) segmenting each type
of imagery separately before combining them. Finally, decision-level
fusion corresponds to the process of quantitatively combining
multispectral and radar imagery to derive the parameter of interest (by
e.g.~combining them in a regression model, or classification algorithm)

\textbf{\emph{pixel-level}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Component substitution techniques: such as principal component
  analysis (PCA), Intensity-hue-saturation (IHS).~\\
\item
  PCA is the only pixel-level image fusion technique that cannot be
  applied to imagery with different spatial resolutions, and the only
  that allows unlimited image numbers.\\
\item
  IHS fusion. Three images with lower spatial resolution (typically
  multispectral data) are integrated with a single image with high
  spatial resolution (typically radar) to retain the radiometry but
  increase the spatial resolution of the former. Facilitate visual
  interpretation by combining resulting images into a single RGB
  image.\\
\item
  Multi-resolution analysis,~such as~**Wavelet transformation. Decompose
  multispectral and radar imagery into their respective low- and
  high-frequency components\\
\item
  Arithmetic fusion techniques:~such as the Brovey transform algorithm.
  Unlikely to be appropriate for multispectral-radar SRS image fusion.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\emph{Object-level}}:~Based on brightness and intensity values
of each pixel, as well as its spatial context, objects such as lines,
shapes or textures are extracted.

1.~\textbf{image segmentation:} Demands that multispectral and radar SRS
images are with the same spatial resolution

2.~*extracting objects separately and combining in a feature map*

Object-based fusion reduces all multispectral and radar information into
a single layer of discrete objects, which are often relatively easy to
relate to ecological features.

\textbf{\emph{Decision-level fusion}}: Quantitative decision-making
frameworks---such as a regression, a quantitative model or a
classification algorithm.

\hypertarget{reflection-1}{%
\section{Reflection}\label{reflection-1}}

Data correction, Data fusion and Image enhancement SRS data fusion can
increase the quality of SRS (Satellite Remote sensing)-derived
parameters for application in terrain detection, urban analysis, ecology
and conservation (Schulte to Bühne and Pettorelli 2018). It is thus
important to explore how best to capitalise on recent technological
developments and changes in SRS data availability. It is exctiing to
apply solid machine learning methods to this area and it is marvelous to
see the progress reflected by the increasing number of software
supporting this application. The improvement of image quality enables
new research designs in ecology and conservation areas and reignite
previously greyed-out options.

The application of data correction, data fusion, and image enhancement
techniques to SRS data can greatly improve the accuracy and reliability
of SRS-derived parameters, which can then be used in various fields,
including terrain detection, urban analysis, ecology, and conservation.
With the rapid advancements in technology and the increasing
availability of SRS data, there is a growing opportunity to leverage the
latest machine learning techniques in this area. The development of new
software tools to support these applications is a testament to the
progress being made in this field. By enhancing the quality of the SRS
data, researchers are able to design more robust and informative
studies, unlocking new insights and avenues for exploration in ecology
and conservation. This, in turn, has the potential to lead to
breakthroughs and innovations in these fields, making a significant
impact on the world around us.

\chapter{Week 5 - An introduction to Google Earth
Engine}\label{week-5---an-introduction-to-google-earth-engine}}

This week introduces \textbf{Google Earth Engine (GEE)}, a geospatial
processing service that allows for planetary scale analysis of massive
datasets in seconds.

Basics:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The set up of GEE, its terms and jargon, and client vs server side
  operations, see Table 1
\item
  How GEE uses Javascript and how mapping functions are used instead of
  loops
\item
  The concept of scale in GEE, which refers to both the volume of
  analysis and pixel resolution
\item
  How GEE aggregates the image to fit a 256x256 grid.
\end{itemize}

Objects and methods in GEE are introduced:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  E.g. geometries, features, feature collections, and
\item
  Various data reduction techniques (e.g., reducing images, reducing
  images by region(s), reducing images by neighborhood).
\end{itemize}

Also, the types of analyses that can be performed in GEE are briefly
covered.

\hypertarget{summary-3}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-3}}

\hypertarget{gee-basics}{%
\subsection{GEE Basics}\label{gee-basics}}

JavaScript, where objects are dictionaries:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We have ee (EarthEngine), a powerful package. Anything starting with
  ee (proxy objects) are stored on the server.
\item
  Problems:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We don't iterate the data on the server; instead, we map (using a
    mapping function) them into objects (variables) so we only load them
    once.
  \item
    There are also some sort of server-wide functions.
  \item
    Avoid using loops in GEE on the server-side, as mapping can
    automatically detect the number of loops needed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Scale:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pixel resolution, set by the output.
\item
  GEE does resampling, aggregating your input to a 256*256, mainly
  down-sampling.
\end{itemize}

GEE-using skills can be a valuable asset for a spatial data scientist,
as it allows for complex spatial analysis at scale. Traditional GIS
software is eclipsed when it comes to both efficiency and scale.

GEE's unique and efficient way of conducting analysis flows is
interesting, such as the introduction of concepts like client vs
server-side operations and data reduction techniques. These was required
by GEE's feature of carrying out analyses on massive datasets (Gorelick
et al. 2017). For those interested in BigData technology, the strategies
(server/client split, no looping on server, etc.) applied by Google here
is a very resourceful one and worth learning. The user end also has to
learn to adopt good practices for reducing data range, which has been
simplified to a series of reduction and filtering functions,
e.g.~\texttt{ImageCollection.filterDate(),\ image.reduceNeighborhood()}(Google
2023b).

GEE's combination with machine learning is also promising in regard of
automating complex analysis tasks, as Machine Learning APIs offered by
GEE support Supervised and Unsupervised Classification, and Regression
(Google 2023a). According to Saad El Imanni et al. (2023), as a subtask
of intelligent agriculture, weeds detection task sees an impressive
performance (overall accuracy reached 96.87\%) when GEE and Machine
learning are combined.

\item
  Variance, on the other hand, refers to the variability of a model for
  a given point. When a model has high variance, it is too complex and
  may overfit the data. This means that it will perform well on the

In general, overfitting occurs when there is a trade-off between bias
and variance. A model with high bias and low variance will underfit the
data, while a model with low bias and high variance will overfit the
data. The goal is to find a balance between bias and variance that
results in good performance on both training and test data.

\subsection{Outlook on the development of EO data
Classification}\label{outlook-on-the-development-of-eo-data-classification}}

Earth Observation (EO) data classification is continually evolving, with
new technologies and techniques leading to several anticipated future
developments:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Multi-source data fusion:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Integrating data from multiple sources like satellite imagery,
    LiDAR, and ground-based sensors will become more prevalent. This
    fusion enhances classification accuracy and offers comprehensive
    Earth's surface information, improving decision-making and
    monitoring. For example, the European Union's
    \textbf{\href{https://www.copernicus.eu/en}{Copernicus Programme}}
    could use this in providing free data from various satellite
    missions and sensors for environmental monitoring, disaster
    management, and urban planning.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Multi-temporal analysis:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Sophisticated multi-temporal analysis techniques will be
    increasingly used to monitor changes in land cover, vegetation, and
    other features over time. This enables accurate and efficient change
    detection and monitoring of phenomena like urbanization,
    deforestation, and climate change. This aligns with the
    \textbf{\href{https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/reddplus}{REDD+}}
    initiative under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
    Change (UNFCCC), which uses multi-temporal analysis to monitor
    forest cover changes and evaluate policy effectiveness in reducing
    greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Cloud-based processing:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The growth of cloud-based platforms, such as Google Earth Engine,
    allows for more efficient and scalable EO data processing workflows.
    This accessibility enables researchers and organizations to innovate
    in classification techniques and applications. The National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA)
    \textbf{\href{https://ncics.org/data/noaa-big-data-project/}{Big
    Data Project}} aims to make vast amounts of environmental data
    accessible and usable in the cloud, fostering innovation in
    developing new applications and services.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These advancements will provide comprehensive and timely information
about Earth's surface, informing policies and strategies in areas such
as environmental management, disaster response, and urban planning.

Pseudo-invariant features to be trained on to make your model robust to
time-space changes

Pseudo-invariant features are often used as reference targets or
calibration sites in remote sensing to account for changes in sensor or
atmospheric conditions and to reduce the effects of noise and
calibration drift on image data. These features have relatively constant
spectral properties over time and space, and can therefore serve as a
stable reference for monitoring changes in other features or materials
within an image or scene.

A flow chart can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig-flowchart} :

\hypertarget{application---to-be-completed}{%
\section{Application - to be
completed}\label{application---to-be-completed}}

In remote sensing, it is often challenging to accurately classify mixed
pixels, which contain a combination of different materials or
components. Endmembers refer to pure or nearly pure materials that are
present within a mixed pixel. By modelling the spectral signature of a
mixed pixel as a linear combination of the spectral signatures of the
constituent endmembers, we can determine the contribution of each
endmember to the overall reflectance or radiance of the mixed pixel.

This approach can be very useful in urban recognition, where it is
essential to accurately classify the different land covers present
within a pixel. Furthermore, it can also help us to understand the
composition of the land cover in a given area, which can have important
implications for environmental monitoring and management. This approach
has been applied in various studies to estimate urban land cover, such
as the work by Zhang et al.~(2018) that utilised endmember extraction to
detect urban impervious surfaces.

\hypertarget{reflection-3}{%
\section{Reflection}\label{reflection-3}}

The workflow of Classification of Surface Reflectance and Top of
Atmosphere data intrigues me, as it differs from, yet shares certain
features with traditional computer vision tasks like image
classification and object detection (in regards of treating pixels as
objects/units). Alternatively, Surface Reflectance Classification can be
treated as a downstream task for both aforementioned ML tasks, due to
its uniqueness in dealing with high-precision satellite data and
unseparability (worth debating) from EO processing workflow (calibration
etc.). Also, uncertainty of classification genres derived from
unsupervised labelling can also be an issue.

Optionally, in supplementation to manual labelling, automated labelling
workflow (e.g.~roboflow) can be introduced to curtail repeatitive works
in image labelling(Nair, Paul, and Jacob 2018). However, manual
labelling is not replaceable at current time (Robison 2018) and the
pinning down of ground truth seems to always need human intervention in
addition to machine automation.

The introduction of production accuracy and user accuracy is also
interesting, as these terminologies are designed presupposing a
customer/producer split, dwarfing precision-recall in readability. The
treadeoff to be made between the two is crucial, and this is
problematically handled by introducing F1 score with two competitive
components, and improved by introducing Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (ROCC) with two ``good'' indicators, true positive
rate and false positive rate.

involves comparing temperature dynamics of low- and high-density census
areas using Earth observation data and determining optimal placement of
greening elements in proposed plans using a data-driven model. The
document concludes that this approach can be universally integrated into
urban planning regulation frameworks to mitigate the localized UHI
effect and ensure long-term city sustainability. Also it discusses the
impact of low population density on housing in Perth, Australia, and the
resulting need for strategic land zonation and sustainability targets.

This week addresses problems in

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The object of using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
\end{itemize}

Detecting changes in the Earth's surface over time

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The advantages of SAR for change detection

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    see through clouds
  \item
    high temporal resolution
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Techniques for change detection with SAR?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ratio
  \item
    log ratios between two images
  \item
    t-tests
  \end{itemize}
\item
  fused with other data?
\end{itemize}

Yes, with optical data using techniques such as

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  principal component analysis
\item
  object-based image analysis
\item
  intensity fusion
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Applications?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    monitoring land use changes
  \item
    detecting deforestation
  \item
    identifying urban growth pattern
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{possible-future-developments}{%
\subsection{Possible future
developments}\label{possible-future-developments}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Resolution and accuracy:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Urban planning: Improved resolution and accuracy can influence local
    zoning regulations and urban growth management by providing detailed
    information on land use changes and the built environment. For
    example, high-resolution SAR data can be used to assess the
    effectiveness of urban containment policies or to identify areas
    where infrastructure investments are needed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Data processing capabilities

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Disaster response: The ability to process larger datasets and
    monitor Earth's surface in near real-time can inform global policies
    and agreements related to disaster management, such as the
    \href{https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework}{Sendai
    Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction}. Rapid response to natural
    disasters, like earthquakes or hurricanes, can be coordinated more
    effectively with updated SAR data, allowing for quicker deployment
    of resources and better management of affected areas.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  New SAR applications

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Agricultural: Advancements in SAR technology will expand its use in
    change detection and monitoring. This will support policies like the
    \href{https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/cap-glance_en}{European
    Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)}, by providing data on crop
    health, irrigation needs, and land use changes.
  \item
    Forestry (deforestation and reforestation tracking)
  \item
    Disaster response (flood and landslide monitoring)
  \item
    Environmental management: SAR data can inform policies related to
    wetland and coastal zone management, such as the
    \href{https://www.ramsar.org/}{Ramsar Convention on Wetlands} and
    the
    \href{https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm}{United
    Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)}. By monitoring
    changes in these sensitive areas, policymakers can evaluate the
    effectiveness of existing regulations and develop new strategies to
    protect vital ecosystems.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Machine learning and artificial intelligence:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Advanced algorithms will be able to identify and classify features
    and changes in SAR data analysis in the Earth's surface, improving
    the overall accuracy of change detection, thus supporting climate
    change adaptation efforts at both local and global levels, including
    the \href{https://unfccc.int/}{United Nations Framework Convention
    on Climate Change (UNFCCC)} and the \href{https://unfccc.int/}{Paris
    Agreement}. Predictive models based on SAR data can help
    policymakers identify areas at risk of flooding, coastal erosion, or
    other climate-related impacts, enabling the development of targeted
    adaptation strategies.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, advancements in SAR technology, combined with the
integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence, will
significantly enhance the capabilities for change detection and Earth
surface monitoring. These developments will have far-reaching
implications for various sectors, including agriculture, forestry,
disaster management, and environmental protection, ultimately
influencing policymaking and promoting more informed decision-making
processes.
